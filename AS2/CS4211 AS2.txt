Client Init

1) WAC sends CM 'connecting request' [disconnected WAC can establish a connection]

2a) CM status = not idle
- CM sends WAC 'connection refused'
- WAC status remains disconnected

2b) CM status = idle
- CM status = pre-init
- WAC status = pre-init [set by CM] [WAC connected]
- CM disable WCP (so that no manual updates can be made by the user during the process of client initialization)

CM status = pre-init
3) CM sends WAC 'get new weather info'
- CM status = init
- WAC status = init [set by CM]

CM status = init
4a) WAC sends CM 'get new weather info success'
- CM sends WAC 'use weather info'
- CM status = post-init
- WAC status = post-init [set by CM]

4b) WAC sends CM 'get new weather info failed'
- CM disconnects WAC [WAC status = idle?]
- CM status = idle

CM status = post_init
5a) WAC sends CM 'use new weather info success' [initialization complete]
- CM status = idle [SHOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN DISCONNECT]
- WAC status = idle [set by CM]
- CM re-enable WCP (so that manual weather update is allowed again)

5b) WAC sends CM 'use new weather info failed'
- CM disconnects WAC [WAC status = idle + remove from CM list of connected device]
- CM re-enable WCP
- CM status = idle

Weather Update

1) if WCP enabled, user can click WCP button to manually update weather info 
- WCP sends CM 'update'

2) CM status = idle
- CM status = pre-updating
- connected WAC status = pre-updating [set by CM]
- CM disable WCP from any further updating requests before the completion of current update

3) CM status = pre-updating
- CM sends all connected WAC 'get new weather info'
- CM status = updating
- connected WAC status = updating [set by CM]

4a) ALL WAC sends CM 'get new weather info success'
- CM sends all connected WAC 'use new weather info'
- CM status = post-updating
- connected WAC status = post-updating [set by CM]

4b) if any WAC sends CM 'get new weather info failed'
- CM sends all connected WAC 'use old weather info'
- CM status = post-reverting
- connected WAC status = post-reverting [set by CM]

CM status = post updating
5a) ALL WAC sends CM 'use new weather info success' [updating completed]
- CM status = idle
- connected WAC status = idle [set by CM]
- CM re-enable WCP

5b) if any WAC sends CM 'use new weather info failed'
- CM disconnects all connected WAC
- CM re-enable WCP
- CM status = idle

CM status = post-reverting 
6a) ALL WAC sends CM 'use old weather info success' [reverting completed]
- CM status = idle
- connected WAC status = idle [set by CM]
- CM re-enable WCP

6b) if any WAC sends CM 'use old weather info failed'
- CM disconnects all connected WAC
- CM re-enable WCP
- CM status = idle
