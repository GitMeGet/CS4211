Please include your particulars (name, matriculation number and NUS email ad-
dress), assumptions you made in system modeling (if any). Clearly, describe the undesirable behaviour in the specification and the LTL property you used to verify your Promela model. Also give a clear interpretation of the counterexample obtained from SPIN

The key property of this system is to be able to propogate the latest weather update to all connected clients via the communication manager. Define the key property in Linear-time temporal logic (LTL) (1 mark)

3. Show that there exists a deadlock and provide a clear interpretation of the counter-example obtained from SPIN. Any additional problems you find in the protocol will of course distinguish your answer and earn more credit(3 marks)

issue 1
CM msg is sent to wrong WAC_id during this disruption
- drop or buffer conn_req from disconnected WACs while another WAC is going through the Client Initialization (trying to connect to CM)?

-- separate channels for conn_req vs handshaking during CI?

issue 2
